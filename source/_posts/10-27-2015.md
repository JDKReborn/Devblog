--- Welcome to the new Devblog! ---
==================================

Today the WebDev team put together this blog site to be used by all teams so that we can keep up with all of our progress. 

This week, we are working on implementing viable & simple ways for users to submit their own posts. As a secondary objective this week we will be looking at new designs and useful plugins for the Devblog.

There will also be a team kickoff meeting on Saturday, October 31st at 15:00 GMT 

Hope everyone has a great week!
